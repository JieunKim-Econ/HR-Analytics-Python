# HR Analytics: Predicting Employee Churn with Decision Trees in Python

# Project Description
Among all of the business domains, HR is still the least disrupted. However, the latest developments in data collection and analysis tools allow for data-driven decision making in all dimensions including HR. People analytics, also known as HR analytics, is a data-driven approach to managing people at work. In this project, we will use a sample employee dataset that describes employees in the company to predict their turnover and understand what are the most important features affecting it.

# Table of contents
The first chapter will concentrate on descriptive analytics, where we will transform the dataset and make it ready for developing the predictive model. In the second chapter we will develop an initial model that will then be tuned and improved in the third chapter. The final chapter will introduce techniques that will allow selection of the best model for decision-making.

1. Make it Descriptive for Predictive: Cleaning the dataset and Descriptive analysis
2. Model Development: Predicting employee turnover
3. Tuning the model: Evaluating and turning prediction
4. Selecting the best model
